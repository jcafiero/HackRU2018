# HackRU2018 - HS Career Guide
### Jennifer Cafiero and Laura Oliveto's RU Hack project
With the use of iCIMS Hack API, we will utilize job openings as real life examples of jobs that can persued after college,
and the major that will likely land that job. High school students can select their favorite/preferred subject, which will
lead them to jobs in that field, and the degree many applicants for that job posting have. This will give them early exposure
to the job application process, which will in turn help to start and shape their career goals before deciding on a major.
